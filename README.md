# MTA Ridership, Accidents, and Weather Patterns (2020)

## Overview
This project explores patterns in NYC MTA ridership during 2020, using accident data and weather conditions to model ridership trends. Our goal was to predict high/low ridership days using various machine learning models.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Cleaning and Visualization
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest

## My Role
- Applied ML models to predict high/low ridership
- Created visualizations and interpreted results
- Contributed to final presentation design and content

## Files
- `mta_modeling.ipynb`: ML model implementation
- `nyc_eda.ipynb`: Initial questions and exploratory data analysis
- 'final_paper.ipynb': Full report of every research question and analyses
- `MTA_Presentation.pdf`: Final presentation slides
